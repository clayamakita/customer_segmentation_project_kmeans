## Customer Segmentation Project: K-Means Clustering

This is a project based on the article [Customer Segmentation using Python](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/customer-segmentation-using-python-e56c2b1a4c73) and the video [Data Analyst Portfolio Project #2: Python Customer Segmentation & Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUli5gIcU0).

__Customer segmentation__ is the process of dividing customers into groups in order to optimize a company's marketing strategy and maximize the value of each customer.

For this project, we'll cover the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
    - Univariate Analysis
    - Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
2. Segmentation using the K-Means algorithm
    - Univariate Clustering
    - Bivariate Clustering
    - Multivariate Clustering
    
The data set is in a csv called [Mall_Customers.csv]() and the project is presented on a Jupyter Notebook called [customer_segmentation_project.ipynb]().
